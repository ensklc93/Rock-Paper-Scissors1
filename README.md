# Rock-Paper-Scissors
TOP Project: Rock Paper Scissors

I want to cover 2 different versions of this game.

The first version will be including basic JavaScript functions WITHOUT Loops. Because according to TOP the "loop lessons" will come afterwards. Again according to TOP, no buttons or text are used! The game is entirely played on the console. 

The first version plays the Rock Paper Scissors game of 5 rounds. The winner is declared at the end.

The second version will come soon after including more advanced JavaScript knowledge. This repository will be updated!
